# About
An implementation of a flow-forwarding mechanism in Python. The system contains a set of endpoints and routers, with information being sent from one endpoint to another using a series of "hops" between routers.
The networks are simulated using Docker networks, set up using a Docker Compose YAML file. The user may modify the YAML file, testing the solution on different network topologies.
Made as part of the CSU33031 Computer Networks module in Trinity College Dublin.
